# Practical-Machine-Learning
This book covers all important machine learning techniques that include: 
1. Decision Tree based learning methods - Decision trees using C4.5, C5.0 and Random Forests
2. Instance based learning methods - K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Kernel based learning methods - Supprt Vector Machines
4. Association rule based learning methods - Apriori and FP-growth 
5. Clustering based learning methods - K means clustering
6. Bayesian learning methods - Naive Bayes
7. Regression learning methods - Linear and Logistic regression
8. Deep learning methods
9. Reinforcement learning methods - Q-learning
10. Ensemble methods - Bosstong (Ada, Gradient), Random forests

For each of the learning methods the implementation source code is provided in the following programing languauges
1. Apache Mahout
2. R
3. Spark - MLib
4. Python (sckit-learn)
5. Julia (Java & Scala based)

The project structure is maintained per programming language wise, further by chapter and then specific algorithm
