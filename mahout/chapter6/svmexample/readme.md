This folder has an example implementation for Support Vector Machines algorithm using Apache Mahout 0.9 distribution covered as a part of chapter 6 kernel based learning methods.
There is still no robust support for Support Vector Machines in Apache mahout libraries and a lot of work is underway to build out-of-box support. There are some alternative ways of solving this problem using Hadoop MapReduce.

More details can be obtained from https://mahout.apache.org/users/classification/support-vector-machines.html
